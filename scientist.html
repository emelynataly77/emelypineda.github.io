          <p class="personal-text">
            Right out of college, I jumped into medical research because it was a mix of my science background and my interest in data. Over the year I spent in Dr. Claudio Soto’s neurology lab, working closely with both him and Dr. Shanawaz, I realized I was far more drawn to the analytical side of things than the hands-on experiments.
          </p>

          <p class="personal-text">
            Our lab focused on how proteins like alpha-synuclein misfold and clump together—a key issue in diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer's. When these proteins fold incorrectly, they can stick to each other and form long chains called fibrils. Over time, those fibrils build up into larger aggregates, often seen as plaques or inclusions in the brain. These clumps interfere with normal cell function and can ultimately damage or kill nerve cells, which is why they’re so strongly linked to neurodegenerative diseases.
            You can read more in this <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-022-00787-3" target="_blank">Nature Review Publication on protein misfolding</a>.
          </p>

          <p class="personal-text">
            My main responsibility was producing purified alpha-synuclein substrate. I supplied around 85–90% of the lab’s purified alpha-synuclein substrate for experiments across all projects. Most research in our group depended on that precise substrate, which meant I had to be reliable and detail-oriented.
          </p>

          <p class="personal-text">
            I was also involved in other projects, including amyloid-beta (Aβ) and seed amplification assays (SAA), which are powerful tools for detecting misfolded proteins. The concept behind SAA is that if even a tiny “seed” of misfolded protein is present in a biological sample from a patient (such as cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF), the assay provides the right conditions for it to recruit and misfold normal proteins. Over multiple cycles, those seeds multiply into larger aggregates that can then be detected. This made it possible to identify the earliest traces of misfolded protein before symptoms appear. This is very valuable for early diagnostics, since most neurodegenerative diseases can only be treated once symptoms appear, rather than prevented.
          </p>

          <p class="personal-text">
            Once the experiments were done, my focus shifted to the data. I cleaned and organized raw experimental results, made clear graphs and charts to share findings with the team, and worked closely with colleagues to meet deadlines. That taught me how deeply satisfying it is to find patterns in data, communicate them well, and have them drive project decisions. It's that experience that inspired my transition into data analytics—where I get to do the same kind of work, just with business datasets instead of protein aggregates.
