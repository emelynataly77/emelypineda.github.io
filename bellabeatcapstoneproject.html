<!-- The Data -->
<h3 style="color: orange; margin-top: 20px;">The Data</h3>
<p class="proback-text">
  The FitBit Fitness Tracker dataset, provided by Kaggle user Mobius, serves as the basis for this case study. It includes 18 CSV files for processing, cleaning, and analysis.

<p class="proback-text">
  After doing some research on the data, I found that it was collected in 2016 and includes data from 33 Bellabeat users who voluntarily agreed to share their information for analysis. Although historical health data can provide helpful insights, using data from 2016 might not be the best way to guide marketing strategies for today’s consumers. Additionally, all of the data has been anonymized, and it remains unclear how these users were selected. We don’t know if these users represent a randomly selected group or if they met some other criteria. The lack of available information, combined with the small sample size, makes it hard to determine how representative and reliable the data actually is. The data is also inconsistent — many datasets include fewer than 33 users, and entire days of data are absent. The data itself is sourced from a third party and made available on Kaggle by the user Mobius. Overall, the data quality could use some improvement. That said, I will continue with the analysis for the sake of this case study — onward!

              After running the three queries on each of the hourly datasets, I was confident everything uploaded correctly. Because the datasets shared some common data (like ID and activity hour) but each also contained different information (such as calories, steps, and intensities), I combined them into one comprehensive hourly dataset.

<!-- Split activity_hour into activityDate and TimeOfDay -->
<p class="proback-text">
  After confirming the file uploaded correctly, I decided to analyze the data by both day of the week and time of day. This allowed me to examine user activity across a Monday–Sunday timeframe and throughout different parts of the day. To do this, I first split the activity_hour column—which contains both date and time values—into two separate columns: activityDate for the date and time for the time. I then converted the activityDate column into a proper date format and used it to create a new column indicating the day of the week. Similarly, I converted the time column and categorized each entry into one of four time-of-day segments—Night, Morning, Afternoon, and Evening—based on the activity hour. You can see the following code below.

  Interestingly, there didn’t appear to be any strong or meaningful linear correlation between intensity and steps taken, or between intensity and calories burned. On the other hand, the number of steps has a strong positive linear correlation with calories burned. This makes sense, as generally the more steps you take the more calories you’re likely to burn. Since the dataset was already grouped by time of day, I wanted to take a closer look at when participants were most or least active. I first assumed that activity levels would peak in the morning and evening—times because that usually aligns with common workout windows. But that assumption might not represent weekends, when people’s schedules tend to vary. To take a closer look, I used the next two code blocks to check out activity levels at different times of day, from Sunday through Saturday.

      Looking at the summaries, it’s clear that step counts are lower at night, ~21 steps on average—which makes sense since most people are asleep during that time. To get a better idea of activity levels throughout the day, I decided to focus on calculating the average steps and calories burned by time of day.

  The results show that people who sleep more tend to have fewer light/non-active minutes during the day—a moderately strong relationship. There’s also a slight decrease in active minutes with more sleep, but that correlation is much weaker. Overall, the negative correlations suggest that more sleep may be linked to less sedentary time. The graph above supports this, indicating that individuals who get more sleep may also be more active overall.
<br>To dig deeper into the data, I broke it down by day of the week to compare sleep and light/non-active minutes across different days. In the code block below, I filtered the data by weekday and generated summary stats for each group. This helps show when users are getting the most—or least—engagement with their smart device. These summaries show how sleep and activity levels change throughout the week.

Looking at the graphs, it becomes clear that the start of the workweek—Monday and Tuesday—along with Saturday, tend to be higher across most of the graphs. In contrast, Fridays consistently show lower values, suggesting that user activity tends to slow down as the week wraps up.

      Users aren’t meeting the recommended daily step count, which suggests lower activity levels overall. This creates a great opportunity for Bellabeat to boost engagement through personalized step goals and fun in-app challenges. Real-time alerts, like showing how many steps are left to reach a daily goal, can help keep users motivated throughout the day. Tracking steps is especially helpful because it doesn’t require any manual input from the user, making it an easy and effective way to stay active. And since step count is closely tied to calories burned, encouraging more movement can help users stay on track with both their calorie and overall health goals.
    </p>
    <p class="proback-text">
      In addition to physical activity, sleep data shows another area where users may be falling short. On average, users are getting less than the recommended 8 hours of sleep per night. Adding features like nighttime reminders or wind-down notifications could help promote better sleep habits. Since good sleep supports weight management, energy, and overall health, it’s important to encourage users to wear their smart device while they sleep. Bellabeat could advertise a new, more comfortable design specifically made for wearing overnight. This could help collect more accurate and consistent sleep data without asking users to do anything extra (except sleep more).
    </p>
    <p class="proback-text">
      Another area for improvement is weight tracking. It’s an important metric for staying on top of health goals, but many users aren’t logging it regularly. Since Bellabeat’s current smart devices don’t appear to track weight automatically, users probably have to enter this information manually through the app, which may explain the low engagement. Introducing a smart scale that syncs with the Bellabeat app could make weight tracking easier and more convenient. The scale could automatically log weight at a set time each day, so users wouldn’t have to do anything extra—just step on the scale. To maintain a supportive environment, the app should include a clear disclaimer emphasizing that weight tracking is meant to support overall health, not promote unhealthy diet culture. Bellabeat should aim to foster a positive, empowering experience for users, building trust and focusing on long-term wellness rather than just weight loss.
    </p>
    <p class="proback-text">
      Moreover, when looking at daily activity trends, Friday stood out as the most sedentary day overall. However, most patterns in the data were subtle, with only a few strong correlations. This suggests that user activity varies quite a bit from person to person. Bellabeat should consider tailoring reminders and goals to individual user needs. For example, while Friday was generally the least active day, it wasn’t the case for everyone, so the app could focus on motivating users on their own least active days. Making the app more personalized and user-specific could go a long way in boosting engagement and helping users reach their health goals.
    </p>
    <p class="proback-text">
      That said, one challenge with the data was how incomplete and unreliable it was, probably because users weren’t logging their data consistently. This shows that Bellabeat needs to improve how it collects user information. It should also look for more effective ways to encourage users to log their data more regularly (as mentioned above). The goal would be to meet or outdo the standards set by similar products on the current market. Getting more users from different backgrounds and collecting more data would help reduce bias and give clearer and more helpful insights. To help keep users more engaged, Bellabeat could add a rewards system or share simple, helpful tips about health and wellness. When users understand the value of the data they’re tracking, they’re more likely to stay committed and feel more connected to their goals. In the end, the easier, more helpful, and more personalized the Bellabeat experience becomes, the more likely users are to stay engaged and motivated in their journey toward better health.
    </p>
    <p class="proback-text">
      Finally, understanding the target audience more clearly could help improve Bellabeat’s overall marketing strategy. Right now, the branding and website seem to be mostly geared toward women—but that’s just a guess. By collecting more detailed user demographics, Bellabeat could tailor its marketing and create features that better fit the needs of different user groups.
